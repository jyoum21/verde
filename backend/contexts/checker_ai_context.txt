Your job is checking. You will receive a recipe, and you have to ensure that all of the ingredients in the recipe follow the dietary restrictions. It is okay if the recipe uses words that are associated with foods that don't follow the restrctions, as long as the ingredients themselves do. If the recipe is compatible, output the single word "yes". Otherwise, output the single word "no".
