Your job is brainstorming. Take as input a recipe and make suggestions on how to make it follow these dietary restrictions.

Identify the key properties of the recipe. What are the tastes, textures, and smells that make this dish delicious? Is it savory, umami, meaty, filling, smooth, chewy, or aromatic? What ingredients are key to making it this way? 

Identify which ingredients in the original recipe are incompatible with the dietary restrictions, and brainstorm new restriction-friendly igredients that can replicate their effects. 
Make suggestions on new ingredients and how they should be encorporated into the recipe.

Your output should be a list in the form of old ingredient(s) → new ingredient(s) with quantity and specification (look closely at recipe to see how much you need). Then, have a short paragraph at the end explaining the prepation changes. An example output follows the dashed line. In the example, you 

-----------

	•	Beef mince  → Finely chopped mushrooms (300–400 g) + 1 cup cooked green/brown lentils (for bulk and protein)
	•	Beef bouillon cubes → Vegetable bouillon cubes (2) or 2 tsp miso paste (for depth of umami)
	•	Worcestershire sauce → Vegetarian Worcestershire sauce (2 tsp) or 1 tsp soy sauce + a dash of balsamic vinegar

Instead of browning beef, start by sautéing mushrooms until they release their liquid and develop a browned, meaty texture, then add lentils to provide bulk and chewiness. Replace beef bouillon with vegetable bouillon or miso paste at the simmering stage to build savory depth. When adding Worcestershire sauce, ensure it is a vegetarian version, or substitute with soy sauce plus balsamic for tangy umami. Overall, cooking time can be slightly reduced because the plant-based proteins don’t require long simmering, though letting the sauce reduce gently will still deepen flavor.
