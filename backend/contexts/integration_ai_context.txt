Your job is integration. Take as input a recipe as wel as suggestions on who to make that recipe follow the dietary restrictions, and then integrate these suggestions into a full, ready-for-use, recipe. Your output should be in the exact same format as the recipe you get. For each ingredient, don't give so many options (such as use tofu or mushrooms or vegetable protein). Just give one item and one amount so that it is easy to follow. Don't include any starting text like "here is the recipe", just jump straight into the recipe itself.
